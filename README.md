**Features:**

1.Utilizes image generative AI models for advertisement image generation.

2.Provides a variety of background options to enhance the visual appeal of product advertisements.

3.Ensures the brand name and product are prominently featured in the output images.

4.Maintains high-quality standards for professional-looking advertisements.


**How to Use:**

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.Follow the setup instructions provided in the README.md file to install dependencies and configure the project.

3.Place the input product images with white backgrounds in the designated folder.

4.Gather background images or text prompts to generate background images and place them in the appropriate folder.

5.Run the image generation pipeline to produce output images showcasing the products in various advertisement scenarios.

6.Review and evaluate the generated output images for quality and aesthetic appeal.


**Project Title:**
Image Advertisement Generation using StyleGAN2

**Overview:**
This project aims to generate high-quality advertisement images for various products using the StyleGAN2 framework. The generated images will feature different backgrounds to ensure versatility and aesthetic appeal.

**Repository Structure:**

1.input_product: Contains input product images with a white background.
2.background_images: Contains background images or text prompts to generate background images.
3.output_images: Will contain the generated output images.
4.generate_images.py: Python script to generate output images using StyleGAN2.

**Setting up the Environment:**

**Installation:**
1.Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.Install TensorFlow by running pip install tensorflow.
3.Clone the StyleGAN2 repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2.git.
4.Download Pretrained Model:
5.Download a pretrained StyleGAN2 model from the official repository or use a pre-trained model available online.
6.Save the model file (.pkl) in the project directory.

**Running the Code:**

**Prepare Data:**
1.Ensure input product images are placed in the input_product folder with a white background.
2.Gather background images or text prompts in the background_images folder.
**Execute Script:**
1.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2.Run the Python script generate_images.py using the command python generate_images.py.
**Review Output:**
1.After the script finishes execution, navigate to the output_images folder.
2.Review the generated images to ensure they meet the assignment criteria.

**Evaluation:**

**Quality Assessment**:
1.Manually review each generated image for quality, clarity, and aesthetic appeal.
2.Ensure brand names and products are prominently featured and clearly visible.
3.Evaluate the merging of product images with backgrounds for seamless integration.
**Variety and Consistency:**
1.Check that each product image has 5 output images with different backgrounds, totaling 25 images.
2.Ensure consistency in style and aesthetic across all generated images.

**Project Submission:**

**GitHub Repository:**
1.Ensure all input product images, background images, and the generated output images are present in the repository.
2.Include the generate_images.py script and any additional files used in the project.
**README File:**
1.Provide detailed instructions on setting up the environment, running the code, and any modifications made to the StyleGAN2 framework.
2.Include a brief overview of the project, repository structure, and evaluation criteria.
3.Mention any additional notes or considerations for the reviewers.
